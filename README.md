# DESCRIPTION

The Weather Dashboard is a React-based web application that utilizes API integration to fetch and display real-time weather data. Built using React.js, the application demonstrates core concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and the use of hooks like useState and useEffect for handling data and side effects. React enables the app to render weather data dynamically based on user input, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. The application sends HTTP requests to a public weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, using either Axios or the Fetch API. Upon receiving the data, React updates the state and re-renders the UI to display weather information including temperature, conditions, humidity, and more. The API interaction is handled asynchronously, allowing the app to fetch live data without reloading the page. Error handling is also managed within React to display messages when invalid input is provided or when API calls fail. This project effectively showcases how React can be used to build interactive user interfaces and how APIs can be integrated to retrieve and display dynamic data in real time.
